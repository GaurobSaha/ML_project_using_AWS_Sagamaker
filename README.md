 ML_project_using_AWS_Sagamaker

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline on AWS SageMaker to predict student scores based on study hours. It includes data preprocessing, model training using Amazon's built-in Linear Learner algorithm, deployment to an endpoint, and real-time inference. Data is uploaded to S3, trained and evaluated in SageMaker, and results are returned via a deployed model endpoint. Ideal for learning how to use SageMaker for scalable ML workflows.
